This program should be started as the server file and run in a dedicated terminal, and then the client file should also be run in a dedicated terminal. The user is prompted by a loop, where they can select the operation they'd like to perform. If the input is invalid, it will inform the user, and they will be prompted again. The amount must be entered as an integer if you deposit or withdraw. The program will crash if a float or another character is entered, and the user is instructed only to enter a whole dollar amount.
